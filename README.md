# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning in Python. We use **Logistic Regression** to identify and prevent unauthorized transactions with high accuracy.

## 📌 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍  
- Pandas 📊  
- NumPy 🔢  
- Scikit-learn 🤖  
- Jupyter Notebook 📓

## 📂 Project Description

This project uses a real-world credit card transaction dataset. Since fraudulent transactions are very rare, the dataset is **highly imbalanced**. To improve the model performance, we use **undersampling** techniques.

### ✅ What We Did:

- Loaded and analyzed the dataset  
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data  
- Handled class imbalance using undersampling  
- Applied **Logistic Regression** to detect fraud  
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
